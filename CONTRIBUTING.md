# Contributing to kcp

We're thrilled that you're interested in contributing to kcp! Please visit our
[full contributing guide](https://docs.kcp.io/kcp/main/en/CONTRIBUTING/) on our documentation site.

Beside that, what coverns the project and all contributions to it must follow
the [KCP Project Governance](./GOVERNANCE.md).

From the KCP Project Governance, the following manifesto should guide the technical
decisions through-out all contributions:

> kcp maintainers strive to be good citizens in the Kubernetes project.
> kcp maintainers see kcp always as part of the Kubernetes ecosystem and always strive to keep that ecosystem united. In particular, this means:
> - kcp strives to not divert from Kubernetes, but strives to extend its use-cases to non-container control planes while keeping the ecosystems of libraries and tooling united.
> - kcp – as a consumer of Kubernetes API Machinery – will strive to stay 100% compatible with the semantics of Kubernetes APIs, while removing container orchestration specific functionality.
> - kcp strives to upstream changes to Kubernetes code as much as possible.
