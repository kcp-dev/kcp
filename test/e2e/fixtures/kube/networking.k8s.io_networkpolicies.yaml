                description: List of rule types that the NetworkPolicy relates to.
                  Valid options are ["Ingress"], ["Egress"], or ["Ingress", "Egress"].
                  If this field is not specified, it will default based on the existence
                  of Ingress or Egress rules; policies that contain an Egress section
                  are assumed to affect Egress, and all policies (whether or not they
                  contain an Ingress section) are assumed to affect Ingress. If you
                  want to write an egress-only policy, you must explicitly specify
                  policyTypes [ "Egress" ]. Likewise, if you want to write a policy
                  that specifies that no egress is allowed, you must specify a policyTypes
                  value that include "Egress" (since such a policy would not include
                  an Egress section and would otherwise default to just [ "Ingress"
                  ]). This field is beta-level in 1.8
