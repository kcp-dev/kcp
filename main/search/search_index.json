Since clusters are intended to be a single failure domain, by separating the desired state from any one \"real\" cluster we can potentially unlock better resiliency, simpler workload isolation, and allow workloads to move through the dev/stage/prod pipeline more cleanly. If we can keep familiar tools and APIs working, but separate the app just a bit from the cluster, that can help us move and react to failure more effectively.</p> <ul> <li>Virtualize some key user focused Kube APIs so that the control plane can delegate complexity to a target cluster</li> </ul> <p>The Kubernetes APIs layer on top of each other and compose loosely. Some concepts like <code>Deployments</code> are well suited for delegation because they are self-contained - the spec describes the goal and status summarizes whether the goal is reached. The same goes for a <code>PersistentVolumeClaim</code> - you ask for storage and it follows your pod around a cluster - you don't really care about the details. On the other hand, you definitely need to get <code>Pod</code> logs to debug problems, and <code>Services</code> have a lot of cluster specific meaning (like DNS and the cluster IP). To scale, we need to let the real clusters focus on keeping the workload running, and keep the control plane at a higher level, and that may require us to pretend to have pods on the control plane while actually delegating to the underlying cluster.</p> <ul> <li>Identify and invest in workload APIs and integrations that enable applications to spread across clusters transparently</li> </ul> <p>Multi-cluster workload scheduling and placement has a rich history within Kubernetes from the very beginning of the project, starting with Kubernetes federation v1.  Even today, projects like karmada are exploring how to take Kube APIs and make them work across multiple clusters. We want to amplify their ideas by improving the control plane itself - make it easy to plug in a workload orchestration system above Kube that still feels like Kube, without having a pesky cluster sitting around.</p> <p>See the investigations doc for transparent multi-cluster for    more.</p> <ul> <li>Use logical tenant clusters as the basis for application and security isolation</li> </ul> <p>Allow a single kube-apiserver to support multiple (up to 1000) logical clusters that can map/sync/schedule to zero or many physical clusters. Each logical cluster could be much more focused - only the resources needed to support a single application or team, but with the ability to scale to lots of applications. Because the logical clusters are served by the same server, we could amortize the cost of each individual cluster (things like RBAC, CRDs, and authentication can be shared / hierarchal).</p> <p>We took inspiration from the virtual cluster project within sig-multicluster as well as vcluster and other similar approaches that leverage cluster tenancy which led us to ask if we could make those clusters an order of magnitude cheaper by building within the kube-apiserver rather than running full copies. Most applications are small, which means amortizing costs can become a huge win. Single process sharing would let us embed significantly more powerful tenancy concepts like hierarchy across clusters, virtualizing key interfaces, and a much more resilient admission chain than what can be done in webhooks.</p> <p>See the investigations doc for logical clusters for more.</p> <p>Most importantly, if clusters are cheap, we can:</p> <ul> <li>Support stronger tenancy and isolation of CRDs and applications</li> </ul> <p>Lots of little clusters gives us the opportunity to improve how CRDs can be isolated (for development or individual teams), shared (one source for many consumers), and evolved (identify and flag incompatibilities between APIs provided by different clusters). A control plane above Kubernetes lets us separate the \"data plane\" of controllers/integrations from the infrastructure that runs them and allows for centralization of integrations. If you have higher level workloads, talking to higher level abstractions like cloud services, and the individual clusters are just a component, suddenly integrating new patterns and controls becomes more valuable. Conversely, if we have a control plane and a data plane, the types of integrations at each level can begin to differ. More powerful integrations to physical clusters might be run only by infrastructure operations teams, while application integrations could be safely namespaced within the control plane.</p> <p>Likewise, as we split up applications into smaller chunks, we can more carefully define their dependencies.  The account service from the identity team doesn't need to know the details of the frontend website or even where or how it runs. Instead, teams could have the freedom of their own personal clusters, with the extensions they need, without being able to access the details of their peer's except by explicit contract.</p> <p>If we can make extending Kubernetes more interesting by providing this higher level control plane, we likewise need to deal with the scalability of that extensibility:</p> <ul> <li>Make Kubernetes controllers more scalable and flexible on both the client and the server</li> </ul> <p>Subdividing one cluster into hundreds makes integrations harder - a controller would need to be able to access resources across all of those clusters (whether logical, virtual, or physical). For this model to work, we need to explore improvements to the Kubernetes API that would make multi-cluster controllers secure and easy. That involves ideas like watching multiple resources at the same time, listing or watching in bulk across lots of logical clusters, filtering server side, and better client tooling. Many of these improvements could also benefit single-cluster use cases and scalability.</p> <p>To go further, standardizing some of the multi-cluster concepts (whether scheduling, location, or resiliency) into widely used APIs could benefit everyone in the Kubernetes ecosystem, as we often end up building and rebuilding custom platform tooling. The best outcome would be small incremental improvements across the entire Kube ecosystem leading to increased reuse and a reduced need to invest in specific solutions, regardless of the level of the project.</p> <p>Finally, the bar is still high to writing controllers. Lowering the friction of automation and integration is in everyone's benefit - whether that's a bash script, a Terraform configuration, or custom SRE services.  If we can reduce the cost of both infrastructure as code and new infrastructure APIs we can potentially make operational investments more composable.</p> <p>See the investigations doc for minimal API server for more on    improving the composability of the Kube API server.</p> <ul> <li>Drive new workload APIs and explore standardization in the ecosystem</li> </ul> <p>There are hundreds of ways to build and run applications, and that will never change. The key success of Kubernetes was offering \"good enough\" standardized deployment, which created a center of gravity for the concepts around deployment. There are plenty of deployments that will never run in containers yet consume them daily. Aligning the deployment of multiple types of workloads from common CI/CD tooling at a higher level, as well as abstracting their dependencies, is something in widespread practice today.</p> <p>Beyond deployment, we could look at connections between these applications (networking, security, identity, access) and find ways to bridge the operational divide between cloud and cluster. That might include expanding existing APIs like <code>PersistentVolumeClaims</code> so your data can follow you across clusters or services. Or documenting a selection of choices for multi-cluster networking that simplify assumptions apps need to make. Or even ways of connecting cluster and cloud resources more directly via unified identity, service meshes, and proxies (all of which are hot topics in our ecosystem).</p>"},{"location":"GOALS/#process","title":"Process","text":"<p>Right now we are interested in assessing how these goals fit within the larger ecosystem.</p>"},{"location":"GOALS/#terminology","title":"Terminology","text":"<p>We've attempted to pick novel terms for concepts introduced here so as not to conflict or confuse existing projects, but if you do spot problems let us know.</p> <ul> <li>logical cluster - a cluster that looks and acts like a Kube cluster but is not served by kube-apiserver (as distinct from virtual clusters in the upstream which are instances of kube-apiserver).</li> <li>physical cluster - a cluster with nodes, a kube-apiserver or equivalent tied to the standard APIs.

For example, <code>kcp</code> embeds the data store for local iteration, but still allows (should allow) remote etcd.</p> </li> <li> <p>Support both a push model and a pull model that fit the control plane mindset</p> <p>Both push (control plane tells others what to do) and pull (agents derive truth from control plane) models have their place. Pull works well when pulling small amounts of desired state and when local resiliency is desired as well as to create a security boundary. Push works well in simple getting started scenarios and when the process is \"acting on behalf\" of a user. For example, <code>kcp</code> and the <code>cluster-controller</code> example in the demo can work in both the push model (talk to each cluster to grab CRDs and sync resources) and the pull model (run as a separate controller so that customized security rules could be in place). Users should have the ability to pick the right tradeoff for their scale and how their control planes are structured.</p> </li> <li> <p>Balance between speed of local development AND running as a high scale service</p> <p>The prototype should not overly bias towards \"just the demo\" (in the long run) or take explicit steps that would prevent it from becoming a real project that could make control-plane-as-a-service possible in the future (in the short run).

It however should not be afraid to make specific sets of users happy in their daily workflow.</p> </li> <li> <p>Be open to change</p> <p>There is a massive ecosystem of users, vendors, service providers, hackers, operators, developers, and machine AIs (maybe not the last one) building and developing on Kubernetes. This is a starting point, a stake in the ground, a rallying cry. It should challenge, excite, and inspire others, but never limit. As we evolve, we should stay open to new ideas and also opening the door for dramatic rethinks of the possibilities by ourselves or others.

It holds some state/data from that shard in memory and pushes it to the cache server. The controller uses standard informers for getting required resources both from a local kcp instance and remote cache server. Before pushing data it has to compare remote data to its local copy and make sure both copies are consistent.</p> <p>The second mode of operation is implemented as a read controller(s) that runs on some shard. It holds other shards' data in an in-memory cache using an informer, effectively pulling data from the central cache.

It is almost identical to a CRD, but creating an APIResourceSchema instance does not add a usable API to the server. By intentionally decoupling the schema definition from serving, API owners can be more explicit about API evolution.</p> <p>Q: Why do I have to append <code>/clusters/*/</code> to the <code>APIExport</code> service endpoint URL?</p> <p>A: The URL represents the base path of a virtual kcp API server. With a standard kcp API server, workspaces live under the <code>/clusters/</code> path, so <code>/clusters/*/</code> represents a wildcard search across all workspaces via this virtual API server.</p> <p>Q: How should we understand an <code>APIExport</code> <code>identityHash</code>?</p> <p>A: Unlike with CRDs, a kcp instance might have many <code>APIResourceSchemas</code> of the same Group/Version/Kind, and users need some way of securely distinguishing them.</p> <p>Each <code>APIExport</code> is allocated a randomized private secret - this is currently just a large random number - and a public identity - just a SHA256 hash of the private secret - which securely identifies this <code>APIExport</code> from others.</p> <p>This is important because an <code>APIExport</code> makes service endpoints available to interact with all instances of a particular <code>APIResourceShema</code>, and we want to make sure that users are clear on which service provider <code>APIExports</code> they are trusting and only the owners of those <code>APIExport</code> have access to their resources via the service endpoints.</p> <p>Q: Why do you have to use <code>--all-namespaces</code> with the <code>APIExport</code> service endpoint?</p> <p>A: Think of this endpoint as representing a wildcard listing across all workspaces.

For example: assume a user <code>adam</code> with groups <code>system:authenticated</code> and <code>a-team</code> binds to this APIExport in another workspace root:org:ws.
