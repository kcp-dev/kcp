# kcp

## Overview
kcp is a Kubernetes-like control plane focusing on:

- A **control plane** for many independent, **isolated** ‚Äúclusters‚Äù known as **workspaces**
- Enabling API service providers to **offer APIs centrally** using **multi-tenant operators**
- Easy **API consumption** for users in their workspaces
- Flexible **scheduling** of workloads to physical clusters
- **Transparent movement** of workloads among compatible physical clusters
- **Advanced deployment strategies** for scenarios such as affinity/anti-affinity, geographic replication, cross-cloud
  replication, etc.

kcp can be a building block for SaaS service providers who need a **massively multi-tenant platform** to offer services
to a large number of fully isolated tenants using Kubernetes-native APIs. The goal is to be useful to cloud
providers as well as enterprise IT departments offering APIs within their company.

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl)
- A Kubernetes cluster (for local testing, consider [kind](http://kind.sigs.k8s.io))

### Download kcp

Visit our [latest release page](https://github.com/kcp-dev/kcp/releases/latest) and download `kcp`
and `kubectl-kcp-plugin` that match your operating system and architecture.

Extract `kcp` and `kubectl-kcp-plugin` and place all the files in the `bin` directories somewhere in your `$PATH`.

### Start kcp

You can start kcp using this command:

```shell
kcp start
```

This launches kcp in the foreground. You can press `ctrl-c` to stop it.

To see a complete list of server options, run `kcp start options`.

### Set your KUBECONFIG

During its startup, kcp generates a kubeconfig in `.kcp/admin.kubeconfig`. 
Use this in a different terminal to connect to `kcp` and display the version to confirm it's working:

```shell
$ export KUBECONFIG=.kcp/admin.kubeconfig
$ kubectl version
WARNING: This version information is deprecated and will be replaced with the output from kubectl version --short.  Use --output=yaml|json to get the full version.
Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"24", GitVersion:"v1.24.4", GitCommit:"95ee5ab382d64cfe6c28967f36b53970b8374491", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2022-08-17T18:46:11Z", GoVersion:"go1.19", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"darwin/amd64"}
Kustomize Version: v4.5.4
Server Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"24", GitVersion:"v1.24.3+kcp-v0.8.0", GitCommit:"41863897", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2022-09-02T18:10:37Z", GoVersion:"go1.18.5", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"darwin/amd64"}
```

### Configure kcp to sync to your cluster

kcp can't run pods by itself - it needs at least one physical cluster for that. 
For this example, we'll be using a local `kind` cluster. 
You can create a new `kind` cluster by running `kind create cluster` in a separate terminal. 

You should see something like this: 
```
Creating cluster "kind" ...
 ‚úì Ensuring node image (kindest/node:v1.24.0) üñº 
 ‚úì Preparing nodes üì¶  
 ‚úì Writing configuration üìú 
 ‚úì Starting control-plane üïπÔ∏è 
 ‚úì Installing CNI üîå 
 ‚úì Installing StorageClass üíæ 
Set kubectl context to "kind"
You can now use your cluster with:

kubectl cluster-info --context kind

Not sure what to do next? üòÖ  Check out https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/
```

You need to create a `locations` workspace for your sync targets, these are the clusters where you will be syncing your workloads. 

You can do that by running: 

```
kubectl kcp workspace create "locations" --enter
```


Run the following command to tell kcp about the `kind` cluster (replace the syncer image tag as needed, [you can check here for the latest builds](https://github.com/kcp-dev/kcp/pkgs/container/kcp%2Fsyncer)):

```shell
$ kubectl kcp workload sync kind --syncer-image ghcr.io/kcp-dev/kcp/syncer:v0.8.0 -o syncer-kind-main.yaml
Creating synctarget "kind"
Creating service account "kcp-syncer-kind-25coemaz"
Creating cluster role "kcp-syncer-kind-25coemaz" to give service account "kcp-syncer-kind-25coemaz"

 1. write and sync access to the synctarget "kcp-syncer-kind-25coemaz"
 2. write access to apiresourceimports.

Creating or updating cluster role binding "kcp-syncer-kind-25coemaz" to bind service account "kcp-syncer-kind-25coemaz" to cluster role "kcp-syncer-kind-25coemaz".

Wrote physical cluster manifest to syncer-kind-main.yaml for namespace "kcp-syncer-kind-25coemaz". Use

  KUBECONFIG=<pcluster-config> kubectl apply -f "syncer-kind-main.yaml"

to apply it. Use

  KUBECONFIG=<pcluster-config> kubectl get deployment -n "kcp-syncer-kind-25coemaz" kcp-syncer-kind-25coemaz

to verify the syncer pod is running.
```

Next, we need to install the syncer pod on our `kind` cluster - this is what actually syncs content from kcp to the physical cluster. 

Run the following command, make sure that you are connected to your `kind` cluster, or export KUBECONFIG as it is shown below:

```shell
$ KUBECONFIG=</path/to/kind/kubeconfig> kubectl apply -f "syncer-kind-main.yaml"
namespace/kcp-syncer-kind-25coemaz created
serviceaccount/kcp-syncer-kind-25coemaz created
secret/kcp-syncer-kind-25coemaz-token created
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/kcp-syncer-kind-25coemaz created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/kcp-syncer-kind-25coemaz created
secret/kcp-syncer-kind-25coemaz created
deployment.apps/kcp-syncer-kind-25coemaz created
```

Now you need to use `kubectl kcp bind compute` to let `kcp` know about this new `kind` cluster that is providing compute resources. You do that by running: 

```
kubectl kcp bind compute "root:users:zu:yc:kcp-admin:locations"
```

Notice that we are pointing to our `locations` workspace that we created before. 

Once you created the binding you can create a new workspace for deploying your applications. First you move to your home workspace and then you can create a `myapps` workspace by running:

```
kubectl kcp workspace
kubectl kcp workspace create "myapps" --enter
```



### Create a deployment in kcp

Let's create a deployment in our `kcp` `myapps` workspace and see it get synced to our cluster:

```shell
$ kubectl create deployment --image=gcr.io/kuar-demo/kuard-amd64:blue --port=8080 kuard
deployment.apps/kuard created
```

Once your cluster has pulled the image and started the pod, you should be able to verify the deployment is running in
kcp:

```shell
$ kubectl get deployments
NAME    READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
kuard   1/1     1            1           3s
```

We are still working on adding support for `kubectl logs`, `kubectl exec`, and `kubectl port-forward` to kcp. For the
time being, you can check directly in your cluster.

kcp translates the names of namespaces in workspaces to unique names in a physical cluster. We first must get this
translated name; if you're following along, your translated name might be different.

```shell
$ KUBECONFIG=</path/to/kind/kubeconfig> kubectl get pods --all-namespaces --selector app=kuard
NAMESPACE          NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kcp-26zq2mc2yajx   kuard-7d49c786c5-wfpcc   1/1     Running   0          4m28s
```

Now we can e.g. check the pod logs:

```shell
$ KUBECONFIG=</path/to/kind/kubeconfig> kubectl --namespace kcp-26zq2mc2yajx logs deployment/kuard | head
2022/09/07 14:04:35 Starting kuard version: v0.10.0-blue
