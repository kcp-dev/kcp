// APIResourceSchema. Additionally, to avoid data loss when round-tripping from a version that
// contains a new field to one that doesn't and back again, you can specify a list of fields to
// preserve (these are stored in annotations).

	// of the object, relative to its root, such as '.spec.name.first'.
