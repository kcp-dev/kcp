// Issuer provides the configuration for an external provider's specific settings.

	// This must match the "iss" claim in the presented JWT, and the issuer returned from discovery.
	// Same value as the --oidc-issuer-url flag.
	// Discovery information is fetched from "{url}/.well-known/openid-configuration" unless overridden by discoveryURL.

	// The "issuer" field in the fetched discovery information must match the "issuer.url" field
	// in the AuthenticationConfiguration and will be used to validate the "iss" claim in the presented JWT.
	// This is for scenarios where the well-known and jwks endpoints are hosted at a different
	// location than the issuer (such as locally in the cluster).

	// A discovery url that is exposed using kubernetes service 'oidc' in namespace 'oidc-namespace'
	// and discovery information is available at '/.well-known/openid-configuration'.
	// discoveryURL: "https://oidc.oidc-namespace/.well-known/openid-configuration"
	// certificateAuthority is used to verify the TLS connection and the hostname on the leaf certificate
	// must be set to 'oidc.oidc-namespace'.
	//
	// curl https://oidc.oidc-namespace/.well-known/openid-configuration (.discoveryURL field)
	// {
	// issuer: "https://oidc.example.com" (.url field)
	// }
	//
	// discoveryURL must be different from url.
	// Required to be unique across all JWT authenticators.
