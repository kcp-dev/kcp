## Code Generators for kcp-aware clients, informers and listers

This repository contains code generation tools analogous to the Kubernetes
code-generator. It contains:

* `cluster-client-gen` to generate a cluster-aware clientset,
* `cluster-informer-gen` to generate cluster-aware informers and
* `cluster-lister-gen` to do the same for listers.

Note that you need to have generated the versioned Kubernetes clientset and
applyconfiguration packages already in order to generate and use cluster-aware
code. Single-cluster listers and informers however are optional and the
generator here can generate the necessary interfaces itself.

### Usage

It is strongly recommended to use the provided `cluster_codegen.sh`, which works
very much like Kubernetes' `kube_codegen.sh`. A common way to acquire it is to
have a synthetic Go dependency on `github.com/kcp-dev/code-generator/v3/cmd/cluster-client-gen`
(often done in a `hack/tools.go`) and then call it like so in your project:

```bash
# Often you would want to generate both the regular Kubernetes clientset and
# the cluster-aware clienset.

CODEGEN_PKG="$(go list -f '{{.Dir}}' -m k8s.io/code-generator)"
CLUSTER_CODEGEN_PKG="$(go list -f '{{.Dir}}' -m github.com/kcp-dev/code-generator/v3)"

source "$CODEGEN_PKG/kube_codegen.sh"
source "$CLUSTER_CODEGEN_PKG/cluster_codegen.sh"

# Now you can call kube::codegen:: and cluster::codegen:: functions.

kube::codegen::gen_client \
  --boilerplate hack/boilerplate/examples/boilerplate.generatego.txt \
  --output-dir pkg/generated \
  --output-pkg acme.corp/pkg/generated \
  --with-applyconfig \
  --applyconfig-name applyconfigurations \
  --with-watch \
  ./pkg/apis
