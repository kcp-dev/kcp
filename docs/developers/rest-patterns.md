# kcp REST access patterns

> Note: This document contains both present state and descritpions of possible future changes. 

## Cluster Resources and APIs

### `/clusters/$cluster/apis/$group/$version/$resource`

* CRUD for a specific cluster, specific CRD
* Long-term, the only access pattern for regular users (non API providers)
* Variants:
    * Full
    * Partial metadata
    
### `/clusters/*/apis/$group/$version/$resource`

* List/watch across all clusters, specific CRD
* At least needed for core APIExport/APIBinding controllers to work
    * May eventually move all other kcp system CRDs to APIExport/APIBinding?
* Long-term:
    * Will never be allowed for any client outside of internal kcp code (?)
    * Variants:
        * Full
        * Partial metadata?

### `/services/apiexport/$cluster/$apiexport/$identity/clusters/$cluster/apis/$group/$version/$resource`

* Access via virtual workspace for an exported CRD
* CRUD for a specific cluster, specific CRD, specific identity
* Variants:
    * Full
    * Partial metadata
* Virtual workspace creates a new request to /clusters/$cluster/apis/$group/$version/$resource:identity
    * CRD lister needs to resolve the identity - exact match
    
### `/services/apiexport/$cluster/$apiexport/$identity/clusters/*/apis/$group/$version/$resource`

* Access via virtual workspace
* List/watch across all clusters, specific CRD, specific identity
* Variants:
    * Full
    * Partial metadata
* Virtual workspace creates a new request to /clusters/*/apis/$group/$version/$resource:identity
    * CRD lister needs to resolve the identity - exact match

### `/services/syncer/$syncerID/clusters/$cluster/apis/$group/$version/$resource`

* Access via virtual workspace for a resource a syncer should see (transformed to location-specific view he syncer should have) for a given logical cluster
* CRUD for a specific cluster, specific CRD

### `/services/syncer/$syncerID/apis/$group/$version/$resource`

* Access via virtual workspace
* List/watch across all clusters, specific CRD

## etcd Storage

### Exported CRD (proposed)

`/registry/$group/$resource/$identity/$cluster/[$namespace]/$name`

### Normal CRD (proposed)

`/registry/$group/$resource/customresources/$cluster/[$namespace]/$name`

### Normal CRD (current)

`/registry/$group/$resource/$cluster/[$namespace]/$name`

## Q & A
1. If we have 2 workspaces A and B, and they each have a normal (non exported) widgets.acme.io CRD
    1. Does a controller need to do a wildcard list/watch against all widget instances across workspaces, even though theyâ€™re from different CRDs?
       @sttts: no
    1. Same question as above, but instead of a non exported CRD, what if there are 2 APIExports with unique identities, both exporting widgets

## Open Questions 

1. What access pattern should the syncer use today?
1. It uses a serviceaccount to connect to a single workspace - no wildcard needed
1. What access pattern should the syncer use long-term?
1. Serviceaccount to syncer virtual workspace. Virtual workspace will handle wildcards
1. What wildcard access patterns do we allow for non exported CRDs, e.g. kcp system CRDs like WorkloadClusters? only system CRDs, while trying to move some of them over to APIBindings
