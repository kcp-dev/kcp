# Workspace Types


Workspaces have a type. A type is defined by a `WorkspaceType`. A type
defines initializers. They are set on new Workspace objects and block the
workspace from leaving the initializing phase. Both system components and
3rd party components can use initializers to customize Workspaces on creation,
e.g. to bootstrap resources inside the workspace, or to set up permission in its parent.

kcp comes with a built-in set of workspace types, and the admin may create objects that
define additional types.

- **Root Workspace** is a singleton.  It holds some data that applies
  to all workspaces, such as the set of defined workspace types
  (objects of type `WorkspaceType`).
- **HomeRoot Workspace** is normally a singleton, holding the branch
  of workspaces that contains the user home workspaces as descendants.
  Can only be a child of the root workspace, and can only have
  HomeBucket children.
- **HomeBucket Workspace** are intermediate vertices in the hierarchy
  between the HomeRoot and the user home workspaces.  Can be a child
  of the root or another HomeBucket workspace.  Allowed children are
  home and HomeBucket workspaces.
- **Home Workspace** is a user's home workspace.  These hold user
  resources such as applications with services, secrets, configmaps,
  deployments, etc.  Can only be a child of a HomeBucket workspace.
- **Universal Workspace** is a basic type of workspace with no
  particular nature.  Has no restrictions on parent or child workspace
  types.

The following workspace types are created by kcp if the `workspace-types` battery
is enabled:

- **Organization Workspace** are workspaces holding organizational
  data, e.g. definitions of user workspaces, roles, policies,
  accounting data. Can only be a child of root.
- **Team Workspace** can only be a child of an Organization workspace.

A workspace of type `Universal` is a workspace without further initialization
or special properties by default, and it can be used without a corresponding
`WorkspaceType` object (though one can be added and its initializers will be
applied).

!!! note
    In order to create workspaces of a given type (including `Universal`)
    you must have `use` permissions against the `workspacetypes` resources with the
    lower-case name of the cluster workspace type (e.g. `universal`). All `system:authenticated`
    users inherit this permission automatically for type `Universal`.

The different workspace types are discussed below.

## User Home Workspaces

User home workspaces are an optional feature of kcp. If enabled (through `--enable-home-workspaces`), there is a special
virtual `Workspace` called `~` in the root workspace. It is used by `kubectl ws` to derive the full path to the user
home workspace, similar to how Unix `cd ~` move the users to their home.

The full path for a user's home workspace has a number of parts: `<prefix>(:<bucket>)+:<user-name>`. Buckets are used to
ensure that at most ~1000 sub-buckets or users exist in any bucket, for scaling reasons. The bucket names are deterministically
derived from the user name (via some hash). Example for user `adam` when using default configuration:
`root:users:a8:f1:adam`.

User home workspaces are created on-demand when they are first accessed, but this is not visible to the user, allowing
the system to only incur the cost of these workspaces when they are needed. Only users of the configured
home-creator-groups (default `system:authenticated`) will have a home workspace.

### Bucket Configuration Options

The `kcp` administrator can configure:

- `<prefix>`, which defaults to `root:users`
- bucket depth, which defaults to 2
- bucket name length, in characters, which defaults to 2

The following outlines valid configuration options. With the default setup, ~5 users or ~700 sub-buckets will be in
any bucket.

!!! warning
    DO NOT set the bucket size to be longer than 2, as this will adversely impact performance.

User-names have `(26 * [(26 + 10 + 2) * 61] * 36 = 2169648)` permutations, and buckets are made up of lowercase-alpha
chars.  Invalid configurations break the scale limit in sub-buckets or users. Valid configurations should target
having not more than ~1000 sub-buckets per bucket and at least 5 users per bucket.

### Valid Configurations

|length|depth|sub-buckets|users|
|------|-----|-----------|-----|
|1     |3    |26 * 1 = 26|2169648 / (26)^3 = 124 |
|1     |4    |26 * 1 = 26|2169648 / (26)^4 = 5 |
|2     |2    |26 * 26 = 676|2169648 / (26*26)^2 = 5 |

### Invalid Configurations

These are examples of invalid configurations and are for illustrative purposes only. In nearly all cases, the default values
will be sufficient.

|length|depth|sub-buckets|users|
|------|-----|-----------|-----|
|1     |1    |26 * 1 = 26|2169648 / (26) = 83448 |
|1     |2    |26 * 1 = 26|2169648 / (26)^2 = 3209 |
|2     |1    |26 * 26 = 676|2169648 / (26*26) = 3209 |
|2     |3    |26 * 26 = 676|2169648 / (26*26)^3 = .007 |
|3     |1    |26 *26* 26 = 17576|2169648 / (26*26*26) = 124 |
|3     |2    |26 *26* 26 = 17576|2169648 / (26*26*26)^2 = .007 |

## Organization Workspaces

Organization workspaces are workspaces of type `Organization`, defined in the
root workspace. Organization workspaces are accessible at `/clusters/root:<org-name>`.

!!! note
    The organization WorkspaceType can only be created in the root workspace
    verified through admission.

Organization workspaces have standard resources (on-top of `Universal` workspaces)
which include the `Workspace` API defined through an CRD deployed during
organization workspace initialization.

## Root Workspace

The default root workspace is a singleton in the system accessible under `/clusters/root`.
It is not represented by a `Workspace` anywhere, but shares the same properties.

Inside the root workspace at least the following resources are bootstrapped on
kcp startup:

- Workspace CRD
- WorkspaceType CRD
- Shard CRD
- Partion CRD
- PartionSet CRD

The root workspace is the only one that holds `Shard` objects. Shards
are used to schedule a new Workspace to, i.e. to select in which etcd the
workspace content is to be persisted.

## System Workspaces

System workspaces are local to a shard and are named in the pattern `system:<system-workspace-name>`.

System workspace are only accessible to a shard-local admin user, and there is
neither a definition via a Workspace, nor is there any validation of requests
that the system workspace exists.

As an example, the `system:admin` workspace exists for administrative objects
that are scoped to the local shard (e.g. `lease` objects for kcp internal controllers if
leader election is enabled). It is accessible via `/clusters/system:admin`.

# Workspace Type Extensions and Constraints
KCP offers extensions and constraints that enable you inherit functionality from other 
workspace types and create custom workspace hierarchies for your organizational structure.

A `WorkspaceType` can extend one or more other `WorkspaceTypes` using the `spec.extend.with`
field.

**Example**
```yaml
apiVersion: tenancy.kcp.io/v1alpha1
kind: WorkspaceType
metadata:
  name: sample
spec:
  extend:
    with:
    - name: universal
    - name: custom
```
In this example, the `sample` workspace type:
* inherits [initializers](./workspace-initialization.md) from the extended types
* is considered as an extended type during type constraint evaluation

You can also extend `WorkspaceTypes` from other workspaces by specifying the path:

```yaml
apiVersion: tenancy.kcp.io/v1alpha1
kind: WorkspaceType
metadata:
  name: custom
spec:
  extend:
    with:
    - name: standard
      path: root:base
```
## Workspace Constraint Mechanisms 
KCP provides two primary constraint mechanisms for workspace types:
* `limitAllowedChildren`: Controls which workspace types can be created as children.
* `limitAllowedParents`: Controls which workspace types can serve as parents.

```yaml
...
spec:
  limitAllowedParents:
    types:
    - name: sample
      path: root
  limitAllowedChildren:
    types:
    - name: custom
      path: root
```
You can also block all types from being used as children:
```yaml
apiVersion: tenancy.kcp.io/v1alpha1
kind: WorkspaceType
metadata:
  name: leaf-workspace
spec:
  limitAllowedChildren:
    none: true
```
This ensures that no other workspace type can be created as a child of `leaf-workspace`.
