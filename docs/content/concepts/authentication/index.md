  How to authenticate requests to kcp.

# Authentication

kcp implements the same authentication mechanisms as Kubernetes, allowing the use of Kubernetes authentication strategies. The kcp server can also be configured to generate a local admin.kubeconfig file and a token hash file, enabling access to kcp as a shard admin. This authentication mechanism is then added to any existing Kubernetes authentication [strategies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#authentication-strategies) from generic control plane settings.

## Examples

For detailed instructions on running kcp with a specific authentication strategy, please refer to the following subpages:

- [OIDC]

## kcp Front Proxy Authentication

kcp-front-proxy is a reverse proxy that accepts client certificates and forwards Common Name (as username) and Organizations (as groups) to the backend API servers in HTTP headers. The proxy terminates TLS and communicates with API servers via mTLS. Traffic is routed based on paths.

Four authentication strategies are enabled in union.

* Client certificate
* Token file
* Service account
* OIDC

You can configure them with the settings from Kubernetes control plane [strategies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#authentication-strategies).

  to the kcp API server."]
```

### Groups Filter

kcp-front-proxy drops or passes specific system groups before forwarding requests.
These can be passed by setting `--authentication-pass-on-groups` and `--authentication-drop-groups` flags. They accept a comma-separated list of group names. Groups specified via drop-groups take precedence over ones specified via pass-on.

By default, kcp-front-proxy is configured to drop `system:masters` and `system:kcp:logical-cluster-admin`.
This ensures that highly privileged users do not receive elevated access when passing through the proxy.

## kcp Server Admin Authentication

Admin Authenticator sets up user roles and groups and generates authentication tokens and `admin.kubeconfig` file. The authentication process relies on Kubernetes authenticated group authenticator.
To enable admin authentication in the kcp server, you need run it in the development mode with the `--batteries-included=admin` flag set.
This setting is currently enabled by default when running the `kcp` binary, but is disabled in the Helm chart.

### Users and Groups

| **User Name**   | **Role**                                                                                 | **Groups**        |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| **shard-admin** | Member of the privileged system group. This user bypasses most kcp authorization checks. | system:masters    |
| **kcp-admin**   | Member of the system:kcp:admin group. This user is subject to kcp authorization checks.  | system:kcp:admin  |
| **user**        | Regular non-admin user who is not a part of any predefined groups.                       | None              |

### Generated Kubeconfig Contexts

kcp server generates a kubeconfig file (admin.kubeconfig) containing credentials for the predefined users. This file allows users to authenticate into different logical clusters.

| **Context Name** | **Cluster Endpoint**   |
|------------------|------------------------|
| **root**         | /clusters/root         |
| **base**         | /clusters/base         |
| **system:admin** | /clusters/system:admin |
| **shard-base**   | /clusters/base         |
