# multicluster-runtime

kcp integrates with [kubernetes-sigs/multicluster-runtime](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/multicluster-runtime) by providing a so-called provider which gives a controller dynamic
access to kcp workspaces. Multiple providers exists for different use cases, see [kcp-dev/multicluster-provider](https://github.com/kcp-dev/multicluster-provider) for a full overview.
