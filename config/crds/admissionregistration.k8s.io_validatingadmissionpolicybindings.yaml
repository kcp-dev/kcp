                      - Exact: match a request only if it exactly matches a specified rule. For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, but "rules" only included `apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]`, a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would not be sent to the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy.

                      - Equivalent: match a request if modifies a resource listed in rules, even via another API group or version. For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, and "rules" only included `apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]`, a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would be converted to apps/v1 and sent to the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy.

                    description: |-
                      NamespaceSelector decides whether to run the admission control policy on an object based on whether the namespace for that object matches the selector. If the object itself is a namespace, the matching is performed on object.metadata.labels. If the object is another cluster scoped resource, it never skips the policy.

                      For example, to run the webhook on any objects whose namespace is not associated with "runlevel" of "0" or "1";  you will set the selector as follows: "namespaceSelector": {
                        "matchExpressions": [
                          {
                            "key": "runlevel",
                            "operator": "NotIn",
                            "values": [
                              "0",
                              "1"

                        ]
                      }

                      If instead you want to only run the policy on any objects whose namespace is associated with the "environment" of "prod" or "staging"; you will set the selector as follows: "namespaceSelector": {
                        "matchExpressions": [
                          {
                            "key": "environment",

                              "prod",
                              "staging"

          ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding binds the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy with paramerized resources. ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding and parameter CRDs together define how cluster administrators configure policies for clusters.

          For a given admission request, each binding will cause its policy to be evaluated N times, where N is 1 for policies/bindings that don't use params, otherwise N is the number of parameters selected by the binding.

          The CEL expressions of a policy must have a computed CEL cost below the maximum CEL budget. Each evaluation of the policy is given an independent CEL cost budget. Adding/removing policies, bindings, or params can not affect whether a given (policy, binding, param) combination is within its own CEL budget.

For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, but "rules" only included `apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]`, a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would not be sent to the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy.

For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, and "rules" only included `apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]`, a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would be converted to apps/v1 and sent to the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy.

                      NamespaceSelector decides whether to run the admission control policy on an object based on whether the namespace for that object matches the selector. If the object itself is a namespace, the matching is performed on object.metadata.labels. If the object is another cluster scoped resource, it never skips the policy.

                      For example, to run the webhook on any objects whose namespace is not associated with "runlevel" of "0" or "1";  you will set the selector as follows: "namespaceSelector": {
                        "matchExpressions": [
                          {

                        ]
                      }

                      If instead you want to only run the policy on any objects whose namespace is associated with the "environment" of "prod" or "staging"; you will set the selector as follows: "namespaceSelector": {

                          {

                  validationActions declares how Validations of the referenced ValidatingAdmissionPolicy are enforced. If a validation evaluates to false it is always enforced according to these actions.

                  Failures defined by the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy's FailurePolicy are enforced according to these actions only if the FailurePolicy is set to Fail, otherwise the failures are ignored. This includes compilation errors, runtime errors and misconfigurations of the policy.

                  validationActions is declared as a set of action values. Order does not matter. validationActions may not contain duplicates of the same action.

                  The supported actions values are:

                  "Deny" specifies that a validation failure results in a denied request.

                  "Warn" specifies that a validation failure is reported to the request client in HTTP Warning headers, with a warning code of 299. Warnings can be sent both for allowed or denied admission responses.

                  "Audit" specifies that a validation failure is included in the published audit event for the request. The audit event will contain a `validation.policy.admission.k8s.io/validation_failure` audit annotation with a value containing the details of the validation failures, formatted as a JSON list of objects, each with the following fields: - message: The validation failure message string - policy: The resource name of the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy - binding: The resource name of the ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding - expressionIndex: The index of the failed validations in the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy - validationActions: The enforcement actions enacted for the validation failure Example audit annotation: `"validation.policy.admission.k8s.io/validation_failure": "[{"message": "Invalid value", {"policy": "policy.example.com", {"binding": "policybinding.example.com", {"expressionIndex": "1", {"validationActions": ["Audit"]}]"`

                  Clients should expect to handle additional values by ignoring any values not recognized.

                  "Deny" and "Warn" may not be used together since this combination needlessly duplicates the validation failure both in the API response body and the HTTP warning headers.

                  Required.
