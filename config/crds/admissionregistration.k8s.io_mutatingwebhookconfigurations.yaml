                        `url` gives the location of the webhook, in standard URL form (`scheme://host:port/path`). Exactly one of `url` or `service` must be specified.

                        The `host` should not refer to a service running in the cluster; use the `service` field instead. The host might be resolved via external DNS in some apiservers (e.g., `kube-apiserver` cannot resolve in-cluster DNS as that would be a layering violation). `host` may also be an IP address.

                        Please note that using `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` as a `host` is risky unless you take great care to run this webhook on all hosts which run an apiserver which might need to make calls to this webhook. Such installs are likely to be non-portable, i.e., not easy to turn up in a new cluster.

                        The scheme must be "https"; the URL must begin with "https://".

                        A path is optional, and if present may be any string permissible in a URL. You may use the path to pass an arbitrary string to the webhook, for example, a cluster identifier.

                        Attempting to use a user or basic auth e.g. "user:password@" is not allowed. Fragments ("#...") and query parameters ("?...") are not allowed, either.

                    - Exact: match a request only if it exactly matches a specified rule. For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, but "rules" only included `apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]`, a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would not be sent to the webhook.

                    - Equivalent: match a request if modifies a resource listed in rules, even via another API group or version. For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, and "rules" only included `apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]`, a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would be converted to apps/v1 and sent to the webhook.

                    NamespaceSelector decides whether to run the webhook on an object based on whether the namespace for that object matches the selector. If the object itself is a namespace, the matching is performed on object.metadata.labels. If the object is another cluster scoped resource, it never skips the webhook.

                    For example, to run the webhook on any objects whose namespace is not associated with "runlevel" of "0" or "1";  you will set the selector as follows: "namespaceSelector": {
                      "matchExpressions": [
                        {
                          "key": "runlevel",
                          "operator": "NotIn",
                          "values": [
                            "0",
                            "1"
                          ]

                      ]
                    }

                    If instead you want to only run the webhook on any objects whose namespace is associated with the "environment" of "prod" or "staging"; you will set the selector as follows: "namespaceSelector": {
                      "matchExpressions": [
                        {
                          "key": "environment",

                            "prod",
                            "staging"

                          Resources is a list of resources this rule applies to.

                          For example: 'pods' means pods. 'pods/log' means the log subresource of pods. '*' means all resources, but not subresources. 'pods/*' means all subresources of pods. '*/scale' means all scale subresources. '*/*' means all resources and their subresources.

                          If wildcard is present, the validation rule will ensure resources do not overlap with each other.

                          Depending on the enclosing object, subresources might not be allowed. Required.

                          that only cluster-scoped resources will match this rule.
                          Namespace API objects are cluster-scoped. "Namespaced" means
                          that only namespaced resources will match this rule. "*"
                          means that there are no scope restrictions. Subresources
                          match the scope of their parent resource. Default is "*".

                    may be rejected by a future step in the admission chain and the
                    side effects therefore need to be undone. Requests with the dryRun
                    attribute will be auto-rejected if they match a webhook with sideEffects

                    the API call will fail based on the failure policy. The timeout
                    value must be between 1 and 30 seconds. Default to 10 seconds.
