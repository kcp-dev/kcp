                              risky unless you take great care to run this webhook on all hosts
                              which run an apiserver which might need to make calls to this
                              webhook. Such installs are likely to be non-portable, i.e., not easy
                              to turn up in a new cluster.

                              The scheme must be "https"; the URL must begin with "https://".

                              A path is optional, and if present may be any string permissible in
                              a URL. You may use the path to pass an arbitrary string to the
                              webhook, for example, a cluster identifier.

                              Attempting to use a user or basic auth e.g. "user:password@" is not
