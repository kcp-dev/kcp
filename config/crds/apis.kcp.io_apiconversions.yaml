              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and

                    APIResourceSchema. Additionally, to avoid data loss when round-tripping from a version that
                    contains a new field to one that doesn't and back again, you can specify a list of fields to
                    preserve (these are stored in annotations).
