			KCP is the easiest way to manage Kubernetes applications against one or
			more clusters, by giving you a personal control plane that schedules your
			workloads onto one or many clusters, and making it simple to pick up and
			move. Advanced use cases including spreading your apps across clusters for
			resiliency, scheduling batch workloads onto clusters with free capacity,
			and enabling collaboration for individual teams without having access to
			the underlying clusters.

			To get started, launch a new cluster with 'kcp start', which will
			initialize your personal control plane and write an admin kubeconfig file
			to disk.
