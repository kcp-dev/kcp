# The normal flow for updating a replaced dependency would look like:
# $ go mod edit -replace old=new@branch
# $ go mod tidy
# However, we don't know all of the specific packages that we pull in from the staging repos,
# nor do we want to update this script when that set changes. Therefore, we just look up the
# version of the k8s.io/kubernetes replacement and replace all modules at that version, since
# we know we will always want to use a self-consistent set of modules from our fork.
# Note: setting GOPROXY=direct allows us to bump very quickly after the fork has been committed to.
