# kcp Logo

The logo of kcp is a hypercube, viewed symmetrically in a way that it forms two
nested, equally oriented, centered regular hexagons with the connecting hypercube
lines clearly visible, either through color contrast or a line.

There are these variants, to be used depending on context:

1. normal <img alt="Logo" width="198px" align="right" src="./blue-green.png"/><br clear="right"/>
1. high contrast <img alt="Logo" width="210px" align="right" src="./blue-green-high-contrast.png"/><br clear="right"/>
2. glow <img alt="Logo" width="205px" align="right" src="./blue-green-glow.png"/><br clear="right"/>

Moreover, there is a red-blue variant:
1. normal <img alt="Logo" width="198px" align="right" src="./red-blue.png"/><br clear="right"/>
2. high contrast <img alt="Logo" width="210px" align="right" src="./red-blue-high-contrast.png"/><br clear="right"/>
3. glow <img alt="Logo" width="205px" align="right" src="./red-blue-glow.png"/><br clear="right"/>

Depending on context one or the other variant makes more sense visually.

The kcp font is [Ubuntu](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu).
