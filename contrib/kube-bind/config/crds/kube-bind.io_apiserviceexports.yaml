                        changed is acceptable.

                        Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources
                        like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be useful
                        (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is
                        important.

                  path for stored versions in etcd. The field is mutable so a migration
                  controller can finish a migration to another version (ensuring no
                  old objects are left in storage), and then remove the rest of the
                  versions from this list. Versions may not be removed from `spec.versions`
                  while they exist in this list.
