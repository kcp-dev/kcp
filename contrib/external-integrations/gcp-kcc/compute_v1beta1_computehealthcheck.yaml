                    Port name as defined in InstanceGroup#NamedPort#name. If both port and
                    port_name are defined, port takes precedence.

                portSpecification:
                  description: |-
                    Specifies how port is selected for health checking, can be one of the
                    following values:

                      * 'USE_FIXED_PORT': The port number in 'port' is used for health checking.

                      * 'USE_NAMED_PORT': The 'portName' is used for health checking.

                      * 'USE_SERVING_PORT': For NetworkEndpointGroup, the port specified for each
                      network endpoint is used for health checking. For other backends, the
                      port or named port specified in the Backend Service is used for health
                      checking.

                    If not specified, TCP health check follows behavior specified in 'port' and
                    'portName' fields. Possible values: ["USE_FIXED_PORT", "USE_NAMED_PORT", "USE_SERVING_PORT"]

                proxyHeader:

                    Specifies the type of proxy header to append before sending data to the

                request:
                  description: |-
                    The application data to send once the TCP connection has been
                    established (default value is empty). If both request and response are
                    empty, the connection establishment alone will indicate health. The request
                    data can only be ASCII.

                    The bytes to match against the beginning of the response data. If left empty
                    (the default value), any response will indicate health. The response data
                    can only be ASCII.

                How long (in seconds) to wait before claiming failure.
                The default value is 5 seconds.  It is invalid for timeoutSec to have
                greater value than checkIntervalSec.

                consecutive failures. The default value is 2.
