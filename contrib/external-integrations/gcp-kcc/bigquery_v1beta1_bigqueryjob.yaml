                    The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data
                    has been split using the values of the quote and fieldDelimiter properties.

                    To use a character in the range 128-255, you must encode the character as UTF8. BigQuery converts
                    the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the
                    data in its raw, binary state. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence "\t" to specify a tab separator.
                    The default value is a comma (',').

                    If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad records,
                    and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result.
                    The default value is false. The sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value:
                    CSV: Trailing columns
                    JSON: Named values that don't match any column names

                    an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is 0, which requires that all records are valid.

                    when loading a CSV file. The default value is the empty string. If you set this property to a custom value, BigQuery throws an error if an
                    empty string is present for all data types except for STRING and BYTE. For STRING and BYTE columns, BigQuery interprets the empty string as
                    an empty value.

                    and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state.
                    The default value is a double-quote ('"'). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string.
                    If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true.

                schemaUpdateOptions:
                  description: |-
                    Immutable. Allows the schema of the destination table to be updated as a side effect of the load job if a schema is autodetected or
                    supplied in the job configuration. Schema update options are supported in two cases: when writeDisposition is WRITE_APPEND;
                    when writeDisposition is WRITE_TRUNCATE and the destination table is a partition of a table, specified by partition decorators.
                    For normal tables, WRITE_TRUNCATE will always overwrite the schema. One or more of the following values are specified:
                    ALLOW_FIELD_ADDITION: allow adding a nullable field to the schema.
                    ALLOW_FIELD_RELAXATION: allow relaxing a required field in the original schema to nullable.

                    Immutable. The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when loading the data.
                    The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped.
                    When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following:
                    skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected,
                    the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row.
                    skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row.
                    skipLeadingRows = N > 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected,
                    row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.

                    WRITE_APPEND: If the table already exists, BigQuery appends the data to the table.

                    Each action is atomic and only occurs if BigQuery is able to complete the job successfully.
                    Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one atomic update upon job completion. Default value: "WRITE_EMPTY" Possible values: ["WRITE_TRUNCATE", "WRITE_APPEND", "WRITE_EMPTY"]
