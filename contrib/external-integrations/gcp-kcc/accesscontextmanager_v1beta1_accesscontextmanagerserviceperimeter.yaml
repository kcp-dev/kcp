                Immutable. Specifies the type of the Perimeter. There are two types: regular and
                bridge. Regular Service Perimeter contains resources, access levels,
                and restricted services. Every resource can be in at most
                ONE regular Service Perimeter.

                In addition to being in a regular service perimeter, a resource can also
                be in zero or more perimeter bridges. A perimeter bridge only contains
                resources. Cross project operations are permitted if all effected
                resources share some perimeter (whether bridge or regular). Perimeter
                Bridge does not contain access levels or services: those are governed
                entirely by the regular perimeter that resource is in.

                Perimeter Bridges are typically useful when building more complex
                topologies with many independent perimeters that need to share some data
                with a common perimeter, but should not be able to share data among
                themselves. Default value: "PERIMETER_TYPE_REGULAR" Possible values: ["PERIMETER_TYPE_REGULAR", "PERIMETER_TYPE_BRIDGE"]

                implicit spec, thereby allowing the user to explicitly provide a
                configuration ("spec") to use in a dry-run version of the Service Perimeter.
                This allows the user to test changes to the enforced config ("status") without
                actually enforcing them. This testing is done through analyzing the differences
                between currently enforced and suggested restrictions. useExplicitDryRunSpec must
                bet set to True if any of the fields in the spec are set to non-default values.
