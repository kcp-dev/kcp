                regional).

                When the load balancing scheme is EXTERNAL, for global forwarding
                rules, the address must be a global IP, and for regional forwarding
                rules, the address must live in the same region as the forwarding

                forwarding rule supports IPv4 only. A global forwarding rule
                supports either IPv4 or IPv6.

                When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, this can only be an RFC
                1918 IP address belonging to the network/subnet configured for the

                internal IP address will be automatically allocated from the IP
                range of the subnet or network configured for this forwarding rule.
