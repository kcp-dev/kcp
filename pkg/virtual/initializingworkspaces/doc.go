// Package initializingworkspaces and its sub-packages provide the Initializing Workspace Virtual Workspace.
//
// It allows for one basic functions:
// - cross-cluster LIST + WATCH of ThisWorkspaces which:
//   - are in the Initializing phase
//   - request initialization by a specific controller
//
// That is, a request for
// GET /services/initializingworkspaces/<initializer>/clusters/*/apis/tenancy.kcp.io/v1alpha1/thisworkspaces
// will return a list of ThisWorkspace objects which are Initializing and for which status.initializers contains the
// <initializer-name>.
// WATCH semantics are similar to (and implemented by) label selectors - a ThisWorkspace that stops
// matching the requirements to be served (not being in Initializing phase, not requesting initialization by
// the controller) will be removed from the stream with a synthetic Deleted event.
