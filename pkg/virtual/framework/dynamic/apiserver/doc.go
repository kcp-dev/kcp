// Package apiserver provides an APIServer that can dynamically serve resources based on an
// API definition (CommonAPIResourceSpec) source and a Rest storage provider.
//
// The main interface between this package and other components is the apidefs.APIDefinition:
//
// - the configuration of the DynamicAPIServer contains an apidefs.APISetRetriever that allows retrieving an apidefs.APIDefinition
// based on an api domain key and a GVR
//
// - the CreateServingInfoFor method can be used by external components at any time to create an apidefs.APIDefinition and
// add it to the apidefs.APISetRetriever that has been passed to the DynamicAPIServer
//
// Parts of this package are highly insired from kcp-dev/kubernetes/staging/src/k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver/pkg/apiserver
