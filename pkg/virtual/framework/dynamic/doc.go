// Package dynamic provides the types and underlying implementation
// required to build virtual workspaces which can dynamically serve resources,
// based on API definitions (including an OpenAPI v3 schema), and a Rest storage provider.
//
// Main idea
//
// APIs served by the virtual workspace are partitioned in API domains. Each API domain
// is defined by an api domain key and will expose a set of APIs
// that will be served at a dedicated URL path. API domain key is generally extracted from the URL sub-path
// where related APIs will be exposed.
//
// APIs are served by an apiserver.DynamicAPIServer which is setup in the virtual workspace Register() method.
//
// Typical operation
//
// The RootPathResolver() method would usually interpret the URL sub-path, extract the API domain key from it,
// and pass the request to the apiserver.DynamicAPIServer, along with the API domain key, if the API domain key contains APIs.
//
// The BootstrapAPISetManagement() method would typically create and initialize an apidefs.APISetRetriever, returned as a result,
// and setup some logic that will call the apiserver.CreateServingInfoFor() method to add an APIDefinition
// in the APISetRetriever on some event.
//
// The apidefs.APISetRetriever returned by the BootstrapAPISetManagement() method is passed to the apiserver.DynamicAPIServer during the Register() call.
// The apiserver.DyncamicAPIServer uses it to correctly choose the appropriate apidefs.APIDefinition used to serve the request,
// based on the context api domain key and the requested API GVR.
